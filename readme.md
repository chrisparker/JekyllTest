## Jekyll Test

A test site for showing the features of jekyll using a GitHub Pages site.

Deployed site at: https://chrisparker.github.io/JekyllTest/

## Examples so far:

1. Using _layouts. This enables you to specify a layout in the `_layouts` directory using tags, and then just have a data file in the right place with the variables. When the data is compiled, the html to generated from the templates. 

See https://chrisparker.github.io/JekyllTest/layoutexample.html for the final page

2. Using includes. This enables you to "include" another page, allowing static content in some places, and a call out to another file in the middle of the HTML
